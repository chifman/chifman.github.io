### About

I have joined the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at American University in August 2016 as an Assistant Professor. Prior to this appointment I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Mathematical Biosciences Institute at The Ohio State University and a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Cancer Biology at the Wake Forest University School of Medicine.

My work is in computational biology with specific applications to systems biology and to phylogenetics. I have an experience in phylogenetic models and inference methods, model identifiability, and discrete and continuous dynamical models at the intracellular scale.
