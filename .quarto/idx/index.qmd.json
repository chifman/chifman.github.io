Prior to this appointment I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Mathematical Biosciences Institute at The Ohio State University and a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Cancer Biology at the Wake Forest University School of Medicine.\n\nMy work is in computational biology with specific applications to systems biology and to phylogenetics. I have an experience in phylogenetic models and inference methods, model identifiability, and discrete and continuous dynamical models at the intracellular scale.
